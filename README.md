I decided to make a game inspired by Stranger Things because it's my actual favorite show ever. The 80's theme of Stranger Things also reminded me of the popularity of text based games. The basis of my game is to escape the Upside Down of Stranger Things through making the correct choices. Players are given two choices and will have to select the correct one in order to advance and win the game. Choices are irreversible. I primarily used functions and inputs, if statements, and a class. Although I don't consider myself to be the best coder ever, I really enjoyed making the game and found it challenging, but fun. I struggled most with figuring out the best way to initially format the game, however, once I had a good structure/format, the story part came easily. I got a lot of help from Blaise with figuring out the structure of my code. As for the story-telling part, I was inspired by the actual Show. I also got help from Ronnie with figuring out the "type_out" function.
